# Docs for sample-service-1

Anyone who has spent more than a month working in a decently sized software engineering department
can tell you the pain of finding documentation. Everyone wishes that great docs for internal
services were the norm but few people are willing to spend the time it takes to make fantastic
docs a reality.

Even when you do take the time to write good docs, they end up being so difficult to find that you
might as well not have bothered. Motivated teams will create a dedicated website for the software
they have lovingly crafted. But searching for internal software isn’t like searching the open web,
Google doesn’t index your internal subdomains (hopefully!).

It’s no wonder that software teams struggle to summon the motivation to produce great docs.
They’re hard to write and nobody will see them anyway.

Backstage solves this problem by co-locating documentation with the service it is for. Write
your docs-as-code in whatever format you like ([MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is currently
supported out of the box), publish it whereever you like, and Backstage will display it in context
where it is easy to find.
